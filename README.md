Project Origin and Purpose

Traditional contract farming often traps smallholder farmers in opaque, intermediary-driven processes that delay payments and obscure pricing. FarmerLink was conceived to:

Remove middlemen, enabling direct farmerâ€“buyer agreements.

Guarantee transparency via Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS document storage.

Automate workflowsâ€”from negotiation to paymentâ€”accelerating cash flow and empowering farmers.

Beneficiaries

Smallholder Farmers: Secure fair-market pricing, rapid payments, multilingual support, and direct chat with buyers.

Buyers & Aggregators: Reliable provenance, standardized quality controls, streamlined procurement, and on-chain auditability.

Ecosystem Stakeholders: Enhanced sustainability and trust across the agricultural value chain.

UI Walkthrough

Dashboard

Presents key metrics at a glanceâ€”active contracts, system alerts, and service highlights (secure contracts, price negotiation, timely payments). Uses Datta Ableâ€™s grid and card components for rapid insights.

Contracts

Offers tabular views of signed, pending, and completed contracts. Each entry links to a detailed view showing quantity, quality standards, delivery schedules, and pricing.

Tenders

Lists buyer-issued tenders. Farmers can browse open requests, submit bids, or accept predefined terms. Clear status indicators show active versus expired tenders.

Profile

Enables farmers to manage personal and farm detailsâ€”location, crop types, certificationsâ€”and configure language/localization settings. Integrated chat supports real-time assistance.

Chat

Secure, in-app messaging facilitates negotiation, clarifications, and dispute resolution between farmers and buyers, preserving all communications on-chain for accountability.
